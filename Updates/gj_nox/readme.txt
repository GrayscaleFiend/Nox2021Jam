Meet Nox, a dragon who is shadow incarnate! From the world of Arcane Gourmet, he can now sit on your desktop. Ask him questions or give him gifts to learn more about him and the world he is from. Or, if you're feeling particularly devilish, slap him in the face to tick him off and potentially insult you. But beware, if you anger him too much he might decide to leave.

Nox comes with four different petting surfaces (Top of his head, his face, his chin, and his wings), a punchable face, a tiered relationship system, gift giving, and a potential to influence parts of his world!

Press R to reload, M for menu, T to talk, and if something weird happens just click on it a lot to make it leave you alone.
